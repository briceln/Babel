HOW IT WORKS

Client send:

0|<username> for connection
1|<username> for disconnect
2|<user to call> for call user
3|<username> for get the list of connected persons
5|<username> for check if someone call me

Server send:

500|<ip> for say call this ip (It's receive when you call someone or you be called)
300|<contact:ip|contact:ip|etc> the list of people who are connected and their ip
404 the people you want to call isn't online or doesn't exist

All this messages are converted in binary and be decoded on the server and the client after reception
